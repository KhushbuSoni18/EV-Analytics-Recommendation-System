# EV-Analytics-Recommendation-System
A complete data analytics project using Python to explore electric vehicle data, identify insights, detect outliers, and recommend the best EVs based on user preferences.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to extract actionable insights from a dataset of electric vehicles using data analytics techniques.

### Key Goals:
- Filter EVs based on user budget and range
- Detect energy consumption outliers
- Analyze relationship between battery size and vehicle range
- Build a custom EV recommendation system
- Perform hypothesis testing between top manufacturers (Tesla vs Audi)

## 📊 Key Results (with Metrics)
- Identified EVs under **350,000 PLN** with **400+ km range** across top brands
- Found strong correlation between **battery capacity and range**
- Flagged **3 outliers** in energy consumption using statistical methods
- Built a **Python class-based tool** that recommends top 3 EVs based on user input
- Used **SciPy t-test** to compare engine power between Tesla and Audi
